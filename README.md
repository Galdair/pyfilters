Py-Filters
==========

this is a repo for some language filters i created in python.These use the Hungarian language.
This repo currently contains:

*pyglatin.py a simple pyglatin
*lomai.py a "poncius Pilatus" text filter
*baszont.py which uses the infamous internet meme baszont as basis

Supposedly they all use stdin and stdout(WIP)
